The project IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_RNN involves using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze and classify the sentiment of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The goal is to train the RNN to predict whether a review is positive or negative based on the text data, leveraging the network's ability to capture sequential dependencies in language.
